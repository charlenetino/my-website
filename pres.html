    <div class="descrpitionpres">Hi, I'm Charlene aaaand welcome to my website &#128522 <br><br>

        Soon to be an engineer, I tend to be overbooked in my daily life. However, sport is necessary because it allows me to refocus, to start the day with a lot of energy and simply to feel good in my body and mind!
        Like me, it can be complicated for you to have a healthy lifestyle because of our overbooked lives even if this is what we want.
        Don’t worry! I can help you to organize your sessions! Read more &#128521<br><br>
        
        A lot of sports videos are available on youtube but there are so many of them that I never know which one to choose and just waste time before selecting the right one. And still, sometimes the video is disappointing and not quite what I was looking for in the first place.
        <br><br>
        Do you feel the same way?<br>
        What I can do for you, is to test different trainings on youtube and select the best ones so that you don't have any more time to waste but just focus on your training!
        So, you can find on my website weekly plans for your training with the best videos already available on youtube! Choose your own adapted plan between the SPORTY, FLEXI and MIX plans.
        <br><br>
        You will be able to train every day of the week except Sunday during half an hour. You can of course adapt the workout to your daily routine. Maybe you prefer to work out for a longer period of time and less regularly? 
        <br><br>
        I hope you find these programs useful and love them! I love them already!
        Don't hesitate to send me feedbacks via Instagram, I regularly post surveys in my story &#128150
        <br><br>
        See you soon my tinos,<br>
        Charlène
